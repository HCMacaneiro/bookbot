# BookBot

This repository contains my solution for the BookBot project on Boot.dev.

BookBot is a Python application designed to analyze text files. It reads a book, counts the occurrences of each word, and reports on the word frequency. This project helped me practice:

- Reading and writing files in Python.
- String manipulation and text processing.
- Using dictionaries to store and access data.
- Basic function design and modular programming.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HCMacaneiro/BookBot.git
    cd BookBot
    ```
2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The application will process a predefined text file (e.g., `books/frankenstein.txt`) and print a report to the console.
